    <h2>“The OLED is the new King of the PC Country”</h2>
    <h3><strong>Michael's Family</strong></h3>
    <p>I have recently purchased both the 49 inch mini-LED and the OLED and have no regrets. You must be patient with the set-up on the newer OLED version and you will get through it. Does help if you already have a Samsung account on your phone. just take picture of the QR codes it will display and you will breeze through, easier. The mini-LED version sets-up like a regular PC monitor, but the OLED does something new to most of us.

        Picture quality is stunning on both monitors. It may be that the mini-LED version may be a bit bettor for office work? The mini-LED version has a more pronounced curve so I think I will give it to my son since he is mainly a game player, with a PC than I am.

        Either one and you will be pretty happy. The OLED is the new King of the PC Country, though.</p>

    <h2>“Looking for the best overall experience? This is the monitor!”</h2>
    <h3><strong>Amber</strong></h3>
    <p>I watched all the reviews for this I could get my hands on. I read and watched 10 plus hours of monitor reviews. Ultimately it came down to this. I wanted the best quality viewing experience while gaming. I didn't care about how much it cost. I'm playing primarily Diablo 4, World of Warcraft, League of Legends and Valorant. The games look absolutely phenomenal in HDR max settings. 
        Well I agree with many of the other stated minor issues, none of them are big enough for me to subtract a star. This is far and away above and beyond my expectations. I don't think I could ever go back to standard 1080p gaming. If you have the money and you're looking for the best overall experience, this is the monitor!</p>

    <h2>"It won't disappoint."</h2>
    <h3><strong>kyrusri</strong></h3>
    <p>Hey, I wanted to share my experience with the Odyssey OLED G9 monitor. First off, this thing is a beast when it comes to specs. Picture a 49-inch curved display with an astonishing 5120 x 1440 resolution. Whether I'm gaming or working, this monitor delivers. 
        If you're a Macbook M1 user like me, here's a tip: use the DisplayPort to USB connection to get that full 5120 x 1440 resolution. 
        It's totally worth it. And don't forget to use Variable Refresh Rate to keep text looking crystal clear; — there is a difference, no annoying pixelation here. 
        Now, for PC gaming, the HDMI 2.1 support with 12-bit color depth is a game-changer. I found that using HDMI is the way to go. Just make sure you've got the right cables handy. Once everything's set up correctly, the clarity is just amazing. Text is super sharp, and the colors are vibrant. Whether I'm in the middle of an intense gaming session or working on projects, the Odyssey OLED G9 impresses. In my experience, this monitor strikes a perfect balance between gaming and productivity. It's not just a screen; 
        it's an immersive experience. If you're in the market for a versatile monitor, give the Odyssey OLED G9 a serious look. It won't disappoint.</p>
